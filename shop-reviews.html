        <li>★★★★★ Great tablet, perfect for watching videos while laying in bed. Can't wait for it to arrive.</li>
        <li>★★★ Good, but really lagy. I'm starting to think it is like 6 years old. You should've written that in the description.</li>
        <li>★ This thing blew up in my hand</li>
        <li>★★★★ Wait, how do we all have this tablet, I thought they were selling a single copy. Great overall.</li>
        <li>★</li>
        <li>★★★ I guess its fine</li>
